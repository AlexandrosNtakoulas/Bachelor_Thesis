# Bachelor Thesis:
## Premixed Hydrogen Flame Simulation and post-processing pipeline

This repository contains the codebase developed as part of my Bachelor Thesis at **ETH ZÃ¼rich (D-MAVT)**, conducted in the **Computational and Applied Physics / Combustion Laboratory (CAPS)**.  
The project focuses on **data-driven modeling of hydrogen combustion** using **Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS)** data obtained from the **Nek5000** spectral-element solver.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

The goal of this work is to establish a reproducible computational pipeline that:
1. Extracts local flame characteristics (e.g., curvature, strain, species concentrations) from high-fidelity DNS data.
2. Performs **feature scaling, dimensionality reduction, and symbolic regression** to uncover physical relations governing the **flame displacement speed**.
3. Bridges **physics-based modeling** with **data-driven discovery** through interpretable and efficient machine-learning models.
